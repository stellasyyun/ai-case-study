# AI CASE STUDY

## Overview and Origin

*Notion Labs* is a company based in San Francisco that created the famous productivity web application *Notion*. It was found in 2013 by Ivan Zhao and Simon Last who are both engineers. They wanted to create an all-in-one workplace where users can build their own to fit their workflows. Notion was able to grow because venture capital firms such as Sequoia Capital and Index Ventures recognized its potential and put in investments. During the recent funding in 2021, Notion raised $275 million and became a company with $10 billion value.

## Business Activities

Notion wanted AI to fit into day-to-day workflows and help with daily work. Its targeted audience is very broad since students, artists, business owners, and companies are using this workspace. Notion AI is efficient because it is implemented into the notes and documents that the users have been using already. There is no need to get a separate AI tool, but it is just added on to the workplace that Notion was already providing. Users do not need to get information in a chat-like form but they have the AI skills built into the editor. Notion AI is known to be powered by Open AI's algorithms.

Current functions of Notion AI are
- Summarize existing content
- Brainstorm ideas
- Write a rough draft
- Fix spelling and grammar
- Translate content

To create a stronger infrastructure for AI, Notion upgraded its data structure in 2022 for better storage and computing power. Below is a quote from Notion's tech blog in explaining how they built their data lake.

>We started developing our data lake infrastructure in the spring of 2022 and completed it by that fall. Due to the infra's inherently scalable nature, we were able to continually optimize and expand the Debezium EKS clusters, Kafka clusters, Deltastreamer, and Spark job to keep up with Notion's 6-to-12 month data doubling rate without significant overhauls. 

## Landscape

Notion is in the productivity field and there are variety of competitors in the fields since Notion has broad usage. For example, Google and Microsoft could be part of the competition since people use Microsoft OneNote and Google Workspace for similar productivity and collaboration tools in work. Another popular alternative would be Monday.com which is a popular productivity management application used among organizations, and ClickUp which is a cloud-based collaborative platform for task management and brainstorming.

## Results

Due to the rise of remote work in recent years, Notion has been growing rapidly as the market itself grows. Productivity software market is expected to grow at a 14% compound annual growth rate and reach $203 billion by 2032. Notion has already reached 20 million users in 2022 and is estimated to have surpassed 30 million by end of 2023. This shows the success of Notion in the market. Competitors like ClickUp has also been experiencing increase in users that it passed 8 million by 2023.

## Recommendations

I would advise Notion to bring in more Microsoft-Office-like features within the AI usage. Notion has a variety of customers but the most important group of customers seems to be the companies. Because Microsoft Office is being used worldwide by majority of companies, providing such technologies within Notion could boost the efficiency and work as an advantage. Notion already is built to have features to replace Word and Excel. Usage of AI could boost the productivity of them such as providing Excel function-like features by AI's choice just by the user typing out what numbers they need to calculate. This could encourage the users to do more work within Notion rather than using other softwares together.
